# Project Memory Game

This repository basically contains a project that I completed as a part of my Udacity Nanodegree.The game consists of 16 cards which are inverted and we need to flip the cards to find out the picture behind the cards.

## Instructions 

Each player has to flip the card to find out about the picture behind it. We need to match the right pictures with each other. In a single move, you can flip two cards and if they match they will opened and hence you have to complete 8 pairs of cards to win the game. Once you have filpped a card, the timer starts and your moves are being tracked and depending on the number of moves you required to complete the game decides the rating you receive. The timer will reveal how quick you were so play the game and see how good your memory really is ? 

In case of any issues, try refreshing or resetting the game with the reset button.
